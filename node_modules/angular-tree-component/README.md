## Getting started & Demos
Please refer to the full documentation:  
[https://angular2-tree.readme.io/docs](https://angular2-tree.readme.io/docs)

## Angular supported version
angular-tree-component supports angular 2.X.X, 4.X.X and 5.X.X releases, and AoT compilation.

## SystemJS
SystemJS is not officially supported.
We've tried to support it for a year, but it just causes too many issues. Sorry.

## Contributing
run `npm run example:cli` and open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to test your code before submitting a pull request.  

Windows users - if it doesn't work try `npm run example:cli:win`.  

To run tests locally - make sure port 4200 is available and run:
```
$ npm run example:cli  # Wait until webpack finishes and http://localhost:4200 is available
$ npm run test:dev
```

Please check the issues / project before starting to work on a feature / bug to make sure it's not already in progress.
